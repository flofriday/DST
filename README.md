## Build

Each Maven module has a corresponding profile that contains the build config for the respective module.
For example, to build the JPA task of assignment 1, run

    mvn clean install -Pass1-jpa

You can add the `-DskipTests` flag to skip JUnit test execution.

There is also a profile `all`, that includes all modules.
You should activate this profile in your IDE's Maven ([IDEA],[Eclipse]) configuration!
